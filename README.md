## Example

## Why *fiasco*?
*fiasco*, or flask, is [the typical style of bottle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiasco_(bottle)) used to serve the *Chianti Classico* wine. It is typically larger and rounder at the bottom and is covered by a straw basket. In the same way, the fiasco package serves up the CHIANTI atomic database.
